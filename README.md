## What is this project?

In fact, this is the first web app I've made and I still actually use it. This app makes me think about the power that programming offers in a way that you can actually create solutions to the problems you have, build something you'd like to use, and share it with others so they can use it to solve their problems. Maybe they don't need the solution you created, but they can learn from your creation, from the rights and wrongs.

Personally, I love this app because it reminds me of those things, and while I could make a much better app now because I've improved so much, I like the idea of freezing this project in time, letting it be what it was meant to be, with its cool and not-so-cool stuff. I still use it every day to manage my daily goals and I love it.
